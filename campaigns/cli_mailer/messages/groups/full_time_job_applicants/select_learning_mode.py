MSG="""You are receiving this message because you have expressed interest in training for IT career.<br /><br />
Although we offer self-study online courses for your career interest and it is available on our website, a better option for you is to have a personal coach, a technology professional who is working in the field to take you, one-on-one, through the entire curriculum. Although it is more expensive, it is a proven route to success.<br /><br />
The training is typically 3 months. <br /><br />
Both options are, however, available to you. Which would you prefer? <br />
