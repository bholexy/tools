TITLE="Feedback on Internship Application"

MSG="""You are receiving this email because you applied for intership position with Linuxjobber through our website https://www.linuxjobber.com<br /><br />
If you have applied for the program and you have not received a call, most likely, it is because you did not specify any project you have worked on.<br /><br />
If you have never worked in the industry, do a personal project & let us know about it.<br />

If this is the case with you, please reapply and clearly tell us a project that you have worked on. <br /><br />
