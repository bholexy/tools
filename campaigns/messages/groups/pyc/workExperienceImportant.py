TITLE="Are You Finding it Hard to Get IT Jobs? Here is Why..."
MSG="""After helping people get IT jobs successfully for several years, we have discovered that the main reason why most people fail to get IT jobs is because  they try to skip the work experience stage of the job seeking process.<br /><br />

Employers are going to ask for this work experience and everyone knows that. However, some people still try to jump straight to jobs right after their technical training without doing the work experience and this results in failures and frustration.<br><br>

If you know anyone that is looking for work in the IT field, please advice them properly. Everything will work smoothly if they take the steps in the proper order. Work experience stage is a crucial part of the process.
