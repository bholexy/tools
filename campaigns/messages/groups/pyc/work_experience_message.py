TITLE="How to Bridge the Gap Between You and Your Next Job"
MSG="""Years ago, many people complained that they are unable to find jobs in the technology industry because employers require work experience.<br /><br />

Today, that problem has been solved. We have crafted a work experience program that gives you the opportunity to use all the tools and technologies that the employers need. This is the exact experience that the employers want you to have so that you can start being productive as soon as you join the team. This is a solution that affects many people who have finished training either in colleges or vocational training centers and are now looking for ways to get started in this industry. Get more information and program details here: <a href='http://linuxjobber.com/homes/workexperience'>http://linuxjobber.com/homes/workexperience</a> <br /><br />

If you still have questions about why employers want you to have work experience or why we are offering this program, I will be glad to answer your questions for you.<br /><br />"""
